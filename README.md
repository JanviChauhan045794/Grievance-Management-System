# üí¨ Hello, Curious Visitor! üëã

Welcome to my final year project ‚Äî
**"Department Grievance Management System"** üéìüíª
Built during my MSc in Computer Science at **Gujarat University**, this project is close to my heart because it solves a **real problem** faced by students and faculty every day: **handling grievances effectively and transparently**.

---

## üå± Why This Project?

As a student, I noticed how complaints or issues (like lab PCs not working or classroom cleanliness) often went unresolved or unnoticed.
So, I decided ‚Äî **let‚Äôs make a system that bridges the gap between students, faculty, and the administration**. Simple. Direct. Transparent. And user-friendly!

---

## üß∞ What I Used to Build It:

* ‚ú® **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Backend**: PHP + AJAX
* üóÑÔ∏è **Database**: MySQL
* üß™ **Environment**: XAMPP & Visual Studio Code
* üåê **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

---

## üë• Who Can Use It?

There are 3 kinds of users in this system:

1. üë©‚Äçüéì **Students**

   * Can submit a grievance
   * Upload a document or image (PDF/JPEG/PNG)
   * Track their complaint in real-time

2. üë®‚Äçüè´ **Faculty**

   * View complaints assigned to them
   * Update status (Pending ‚Üí Resolved)
   * Generate reports & handle complaints by category

3. üë©‚Äçüíº **Admin**

   * Manages students, faculty, and complaints
   * Assigns complaints to the right faculty
   * Can view full system reports and stats
   * Notifies faculty about new grievances

---

## üß† What Does It Actually Do?

‚úÖ Complaint submission with file upload
‚úÖ Auto-generates a unique ID for each grievance
‚úÖ Keeps all users updated about the status
‚úÖ Supports complaint categories (Library, Infrastructure, Lab, etc.)
‚úÖ Admin can assign & reassign complaints easily
‚úÖ Real-time updates reflect on dashboards
‚úÖ Generates reports you can export

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è A Little Peek into How It Looks

* Clean, Bootstrap-styled interface
* User-friendly forms
* Real-time dashboards for faculty & admin
* Easy-to-use filters and search functionality
* Neatly presented reports

*(Screenshots available in the documentation ‚Äî trust me, it looks clean & professional üòâ)*

## üöÄ Future Plans

I‚Äôm planning to take this even further:

* Deploy it on AWS or another cloud platform
* Improve the authentication flow (OAuth/2FA)
* Add charts & analytics dashboards
* Make it responsive for mobile users
* Polish it into a Progressive Web App (PWA)
